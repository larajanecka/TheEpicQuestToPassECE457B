When training our two neural networks, the quantity of data used to train each was significantly less than what a real trained network would require. The beat and media files necessary were only extracted for 300 songs from the dataset we used. A neural network with many neurons like our Keras model would require many training inputs in order for backpropagation to update the weights accordingly.
