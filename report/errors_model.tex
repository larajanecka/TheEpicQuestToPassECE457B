The neural network models we used were simplistic in nature and not well suited to the problem. Although multilayer perceptron models can be used to classify non-linearly separable sets, other neural network models are more well suited. Specifically, models that use the concept of \textbf{memory} where previous inputs have a persistent affect on new ones, would have been useful. Such models are optimal for analyzing sequential streams of data or inputs like our audio files. Recurrent neural networks belong in this category and will be elaborated on in the conclusion.
